# EOS - The Open Source Lighting Engine & Controller
Our goal is it to create a open source lighting engine that has simmilar capabilities of the enterprise models. We want to make the access to a solid and production ready Lighting Engine as easy as possible.

# Why EOS?
Eos is the goddess of the dawn in Greek mythology. She is the daughter of the Titans Hyperion and Theia, and the sister of the Sun (Helios) and the Moon (Selene). Every morning, Eos rose from her home at the edge of the river Oceanus to bring forth the light of day.
